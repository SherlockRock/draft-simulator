Canvas Functionality:
    share link broken on prod?
    share link for edit access
    replace draft list button Functionality with right click menus?
        editing from the manage canvas' dialog
    Export draft
    connection arrows
    folder heirarchy
    enforce unique names when copying drafts
    seperating canvas drafts from "real" drafts
    manage connection type/color?
    quick traversal of draft through tab/enter
    canvas select opens briefly when clearing champ
    double clicking into draft name causes success toast to spawn
    Pressing enter bypasses champ being disabled
    clearing champ text then clicking out does not clear champ img

Short Term:
    delete draft functionality
    weird auth flow when a user was signed in but became outdated
    searchable select need to fix arrow key controls
    server tweaks when json token is too old? then draft wasn't loading for some reason
    Bottom of champ list doesn't display right when uneven number of champs
    Allow non signed in users to see a non saving draft
    need to handle all cases where res.ok is false
    fix or remove current user count

Long Term:
